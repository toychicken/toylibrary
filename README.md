##Trying again with the toy library

#How to describe this?

It's sort of an application framework, rather than a library. 
It uses a simple pub/sub approach for messaging, that I hope can synchronise across front and backend (though am focussing on front-end to start with)

#Why?

I don't have any grand plans for this, I don't propose that it will be in the same order of awesomeness as Ember.js or Meteor.js, but possibly somewhere in the junior leagues of the same game :)
